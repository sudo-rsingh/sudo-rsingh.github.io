      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I am Rakshit — a passionate Engineer with a knack for solving real-world problems
        through technology. I had the honor of being selected for Google Summer of Code 2022,
        where I contributed to impactful open-source projects. As the president of the ML4E
        Club, I lead initiatives to make machine learning more accessible and engaging for
        enthusiasts.
        <br>
        I enjoy exploring diverse challenges, and my team won the prestigious Ethos Hackathon
        at IIT Guwahati, showcasing innovative solutions. Beyond coding, I am building a personal
        blog to share my thoughts, projects, and interests in a simple yet timeless format. Stay
        tuned for exciting posts about tech, daily life, and a touch of nostalgia.
        <br>
        Let us connect and create something amazing together!
