                The website which you are seeing right now is a culmination of a very long series of
                iterations and learnings gathered over a very long time. It took more than a whole year
                for all these knowledge to start making sense and I was able to get a right mix of
                it for creating this beauty.
                <br>
                In this blog we will go through the history of how step by step this was made.
                <br>
                Last year Tony Davis became my mentor. He was/is a amzing guy had worked in militry then
                shifted to academics. Another thing about him was his personal website, it was beutiful
                and very well made. This was the ignition which I needed to start wanting to have one
                site for myself also.
                <br>
                Well then with all the worlds motivation I started working on making my dream site where
                I can do blogging and write whatever I want easily and it will be the smothest experience
                to have every happened.
                <br>
                <strong>Site 1: </strong> I made a website following a youtube tutorial from pixigami [1],
                that was an amazing tutorial and I was able to make a wonderful site, you can check it out
                in the archive [2].
                <br>
                <strong>Site 2: </strong> Actually speaking the current version is the actual site 2. I
                made a site with html rendering from markdown. Currently i am writing html actually. And
                I now find that it is not that difficult to do.
                <br>
                <strong>Future Plan: </strong> My imidiate plan is to have seperate pages for news, blogs
                and projects sections. Then work on adding a better markdown to html converter, most
                probably I will write it myself now using some simple dictionary for conversion.
                <br> Thank You,
                <br> Rakshit Kumar Singh
