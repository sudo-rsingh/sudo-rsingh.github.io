            The website which you are seeing right now is a culmination of a very long series of
            iterations and learnings gathered over a very long time. It took more than a whole year
            for all these knowledge to start making sense and I was able to get a right mix of
            it for creating this beauty.
            <br>
            In this blog we will go through the history of how step by step this was made.
            <br>
            Last year Tony Davis became my mentor. He was/is a amzing guy had worked in militry then
            shifted to academics. Another thing about him was his personal website, it was beutiful
            and very well made. This was the ignition which I needed to start wanting to have one
            site for myself also.
            <br>
            Well then with all the worlds motivation I started working on making my dream site where
            I can do blogging and write whatever I want easily and it will be the smothest experience
            to have every happened.
            <br>
            <strong>Site 1: </strong> I made a website following a youtube tutorial.
            <br>
            <strong>Future Plan: </strong> My imidiate plan is to have seperate pages for news, blogs
            and projects sections. Then work on adding a better markdown to html converter, most
            probably I will write it myself now using some simple dictionary for conversion.
